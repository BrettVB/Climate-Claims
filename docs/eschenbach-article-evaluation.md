# The Solution to Dissolution - Evaluating the Claim
While performing my climate claims research, I came across an article titled “The Solution to Dissolution” by Eschenbach, which speaks about ocean acidification, referencing a Guardian post about the problems it poses to the shells of Dungeness crabs from a 2020 study by Bednaršek (Aratani, 2020; Eschenbach, 2020). I was drawn to this post because ocean acidification also has an effect on coral reefs, a subject of interest for me concerning climate change, as well as the direction of my research group. Additionally, the Eschenbach article presented data and counterpoints which on the surface level seemed to be at least somewhat compelling, so I was interested in exploring them further. 
## Source Views Conflicted With the Author's
To start off, I examined some of the sources that Eschenbach referenced in their article, one of which that stood out was for Figure 3, as the data shown within it came from the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System, or CeNCOOS. After examining the source, I found that they actively advocate for monitoring and preventing impacts of ocean acidification (Ocean Acidification & Hypoxia, 2021). Considering that Eschenbach is advocating for the idea that ocean acidification is not as large of an issue as it seems, it is strange that some of their data is coming from a company which recognizes the opposite.
## Data Was Misleadingly Presented in the Author's Favour
At this same point in their article, they talk about how the pH of the ocean is only projected to lower by 0.08 if the current trend continues (Eschenbach, 2020). What they fail to mention, however, is that pH is meant to be a scaled representation of acidity. The logarithmic scale that pH is based on makes something small like a change of 0.1 pH at the ocean surface translate to a 30% increase in acidity (Ocean acidification, 2021).
## Criticism of the Main Study Was Inaccurate
Another part of the Eschenbach article talks about one of the methods used in the actual study by Bednaršek. They claim in the section that using a 6% sodium hypochlorite solution to dissolve the carapace epicuticle, the shell layer that the study wanted to record dissolution observations on, was ironic and added to the unreasonableness of the study (Eschenbach, 2020). A quick read of Bednaršek’s study however shows the methodology used was scrutinized by the team to ensure it was accurate, with modelling data used to ensure none of their methods tampered with what they were trying to observe (Bednaršek et al., 2020). This essentially reduces Eschenbach’s argument to the thorough and careful methods of Bednaršek’s team is inadequate because they are using an alkaline solution, of much greater alkalinity than the ocean, to dissolve the shells to gather information, which isn’t a very strong point.
## Arguments Focused On the Wrong Things
After multiple read throughs of Eschenbach’s article, it also easy to see how picky they are about things that don’t really pertain to what they are trying to argue. One such example of this is when Eschenbach claims that ‘acidification’ is an inaccurate term to use, and ‘neutralization’ would be more accurate (Eschenbach, 2020). They spend a large portion of the article on this point alone, which is simply a matter of word choice, and not even an inaccurate choice in the first place.
## In Conclusion
Overall, while at first Eschenbach may seem to have a point or two in their article, it doesn’t take a large amount of effort to find more reputable sources, or even sources they used themselves, that discuss ocean acidification and its harmful effects with much more credibility.
